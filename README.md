Master Password
===============

Unofficial Android implementation of the [Masterpassword Algorithm](http://www.masterpasswordapp.com)
Completely compatible with this App.
Modified by Belogron (December 2014). Original version found [here](https://github.com/dkunzler/masterpassword)
I did not like the icon, so I changed it and maybe I'll implement some more features/ change other design aspects.

License is GPLv3 because of the used master password algorithm.

> If you want to use source code that does not interact with the algorithm please contact me(dkunzler) for special licensing.

I'm not sure if this is even allowed under GPL License, so I'll just ignore it and use/modify/do whatever with this FREE software
